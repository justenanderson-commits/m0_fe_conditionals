# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Very. They are pretty simple. Please let me know if I'm missing anything :)

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Same as above.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
For what we've covered so far, very comfortable. As we begin packing more into the code block, I know that may change.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
An enormous amount. 3.5 hours in total. I had no idea it would take sooo long. To be fair, I did have a few technical issues that slowed me down.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice pushing to and cloning from GitHub. As it's nearly 11 p.m., I've already adjusted my calendar lol :)

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None for now.
